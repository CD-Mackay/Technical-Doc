      <p>Coding seems daunting at first, however as you get into it many new programmers discover it is just as difficult and alien as they had originally suspected</p>
      <p>Fear not however! Many useful resources are available to coding newbies to help them along. This page is a test project for one of those resources. Here are a few</p>
        <ul>
          <li>FreeCodeCamp</li>
          <li>Codewars</li>
          <li>Beg Karl for help</li>

      <p>FreeCodeCamp should be the first stop on the road to            success for an ambitious new developer. This open-source learning resource provides students with lessons beginning from total basics, all the way up to complex subjects such as machine learning<p>
      <p>As a testament to FCC's efficacy, the author of this page had no prior coding experience three months ago</p>

      <p>Codewars is less of a stand-alone resource than FCC, but nonetheless can be extremely useful in developing coding skills. Many issues in web development require Devs to calmly work towards logical solutions to issues. Codewars provides practice problems for Devs to sharpen their skills without the hassle of opening existing projects</p>
    <p>Practice makes perfect, iron sharpens iron and all that, so better get in the Dojo!</p>
    <p>For example, this practice question asks the user to troubleshoot why this section of code is not working properly<p>
    <code>
      function multiply(a, b){
      a * b
      }
    </code>

      <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and is one of the primary building blocks of the modern internet. See below for an example of how it is used to create web pages </p>
    <code> #introduction{
      text-size: 20px;
      }
    </code>
    <p>The example above changes the font size of the introduction  paragraph from the standard font to the user-selected 20  pixels</p>

      <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets provides instructions for  the aesthetic aspects of web design. Formatting of elements, color schemes, text fonts and many other aspects of design are controlled by CSS code<p>
    <code>
      #introduction{
        color: black;
        background-color: gray;
      }
    </code>
    <p>The script above provides styling instructions for an element classified as the introduction. According to the code above the introductory section of the document will contain black text over a gray background</p>
    <p>CSS can also be used to alter the physical layout of a web-page, displaying HTML content in multiple formats depending on the device.
      <br>
    <code>
      @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
    </code>
    <p>The code above is known as a media query. For devices with a screen-width of 600 pixels or less, the background will be displayed as light blue.</p.>
  <br>
    <code>@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: black;
  }
}
  </code>
  <p>This second media query addresses larger screen sizes. Notice that the code only comes into effect if the screen size is larger than 600 pixels.</p>
